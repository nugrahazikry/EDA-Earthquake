# EDA and Visualization of Indonesia Earthquake Over the last 20 years

## Introduction
Indonesia is a country with a high possibilities of natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, forest fires, floods, and, most notably, earthquakes. Every day, I received an earthquake notification from my phone's Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical agency application. Not just one, but sometimes two or three notifications appeared in one day, informing me that there has been an earthquake in one of Indonesia's regions. This inspired me to create an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of how many earthquakes occurred in the Indonesia region over the last 20 years.

Earthquakes are known as one of the most destructive natural disasters, capable of destroying nearby towns in a split second with no warning. A Tectonic earthquake is one of the natural phenomenon caused by the movement of the earthâ€™s crust. A Tectonic earthquake is the most frequent type of earthquake. Earthquake power can be recorded and measured as the earthquake magnitude. The magnitude can be recorded using seismograph with the output of earthquake power in Richter scale. 

The Indonesian archipelago is located on the tectonic zone where the Pacific, Eurasian, and Indo-Australian plates collide. Because Indonesia is at the center of a complex tectonic zone, earthquakes occur almost every day more than three times. According to data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) website, 90 % of earthquakes, including the largest, occurred along the Ring of Fire region. Surprisingly, Indonesia is located above the ring of fire and the complex tectonic zone.

The EDA and data visualization can be used to visualize the number of earthquake occurrences. In this article, I will use the R programming language to perform EDA and visualize data to obtain specific information. The dataset was gathered from USGS website, which collects data on earthquakes that occur around the world. We will be using earthquake data from the years 2000 to 2020.

## EDA and Visualization
The majority of the data in the dataset comes from earthquakes recorded in ASEAN countries. We must specify the coordinates of the Indonesian territory so that the data can only be filled with earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian region.
